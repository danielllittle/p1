<li>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</li>
<p>I'm an ALM IT student concentrating in software engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;I work in Silicon Valley/San Francisco.</p>
<li>Why are you taking this course?

<p>Initially, the favorable course ratings and reviews made me take special notice of this course.   With PHP/HTML/CSS, I'm pushing myself a bit to get outside of my comfort zone of core java development.</p>     

<li>What previous experience do you have with programming?
<p>I have a great deal of experience on server-side application devlopment.   </p>

<li>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</li>
<p>All of the above.   I personally I use a mac.   When I am at work or school, I am just as comfortable working with Windows and Unix/Linux as well. 
<li>Anything else we should know?
